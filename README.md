This README will describe how to host a resume on github. An integral part of hosting on github is having a good README. The README assoicated with my resume (that you are currently reading), will both explain and demonstrate what a good README is.

You can see my resume [here](bradenjonsson00.github.io).

## Getting Started

1. To create a resume that you can host on github, first you must create a repository named "[yourusername].github.io".
2. Then create a markdown formatted resume file in that repositroy named "index.md". Once that is created you can see your resume at the URL:"[yourusername].github.io"
3. Then create \_config.yml, which does ...
4. Then create a README to explain your repository, resume, etc.

### Prerequisites

 - Install Jekyll

### Installing

 - Here is a guide to install Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

### Modern Technical Writing

The book "Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation" by Andrew Etter, has heavily influenced the creation of this README, and the resume associated with it. I will be highlighting principles from that book.

#### Create a static site with Github pages and Jekyll

"You should build and host a website, not distribute PDFs â€¦ PDFs get downloaded onto hard drives and then sit there like day-old bagels, growing more and more stale until they're actively harmful. You can never update them."

"\[Static websites] have no server-side application dependencies, no databases, and nothing to install"

#### Misc

"leverage all the wonderful writing that developers and testers produce"
"Consistency is king"
