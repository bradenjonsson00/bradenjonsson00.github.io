This README will describe how to host a resume on github. An integral part of hosting on github is having a good README. The README assoicated with my resume (that you are currently reading), will both explain and demonstrate what a good README is.

## Getting Started

You can see my resume [here](bradenjonsson00.github.io).

To create a resume that you can host on github, first you must create a repository named "[yourusername].github.io".

Then create a markdown formatted resume file in that repositroy named "index.md". Once that is created you can see your resume at the URL:"[yourusername].github.io"

Then create \_config.yml does ...

The create a README to explain your repository, resume, etc.
